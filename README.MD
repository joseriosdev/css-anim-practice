# Animations done entirely with CSS

[Here's the project](https://joseriosdev.github.io/css-anim-practice/)

This was an interest project, I did some animations before as an digital artist, drawing by drawing and now that I'm doing my transition to web development I'm truly **amazed** with the animation level that we can acomplish by writing code and not using an animation software.

## What I learned

* The use of  `@keyframes` with the diverse elements
* Transitions in `CSS`
* Understanding of the many properties that we got access by adding `animation: ` or `transition: ` within an element
* The use of `transform: ` and many more properties perfectly created to modify the look of an element
